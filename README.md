# Projects for fullstackopen
This is a collection of projects done for the 2022 version of the course on fullstackopen.com

Fullstackopen is a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) created by the computer science department at The University of Helsinki. Here I will **not** be completing the course exams as I am not enrolled at that university, and therefore will not be given university credit. However, I believe there are certain certificates given for completion of all the required assignments/projects, regardless of my student status at the university.

### Topics include:
- Fundamentals of Web apps
- Communicating with server
- Programming a server with NodeJS and Express
- Testing Express servers, user administration
- Testing React apps
- State management with Redux
- React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack
- GraphQL
- TypeScript
- React Native
- CI/CD
- Containers
- Using Relational databases

Some of these topics I already have experience with, either with my own self study or in courses at my own university, but I will still complete those as a refresher.

According to fullstackopen.com, all 13 parts of this course are equivalent to 14 credits at the university.
