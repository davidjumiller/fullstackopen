# Projects for fullstackopen
This is a collection of projects done for the 2022 version of the course on fullstackopen.com

Fullstackopen is a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) created by the computer science department at The University of Helsinki. Upon completing an exam on the topics I would receive credits at the university, however, since I have already finished my degree it is unnecessary at this time.

### Topics included and completed:
- Fundamentals of Web apps ✅
- Communicating with server ✅
- Programming a server with NodeJS and Express ✅
- Testing Express servers, user administration ✅
- Testing React apps
- State management with Redux
- React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack
- GraphQL
- TypeScript
- React Native
- CI/CD ✅
- Containers
- Using Relational databases

Some of these topics I already have experience with, either with my own self study or in courses at my own university, but I will still complete those as a refresher.

According to fullstackopen.com, all 13 parts of this course are equivalent to 14 credits at the university, and each take on average 20 hours.

Below are the certificates for completing certain parts.
