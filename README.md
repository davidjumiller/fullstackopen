# Projects for fullstackopen
This is a collection of projects done for the 2022 version of the course on fullstackopen.com

Fullstackopen is a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) created by the computer science department at The University of Helsinki. Upon completing an exam on the topics I would receive credits at the university, however, since I have already finished my degree it is unnecessary at this time.

### Topics included:
- Part 0: Fundamentals of Web apps ✅
- Part 1: Introduction to React ✅
- Part 2: Communicating with server ✅
- Part 3: Programming a server with NodeJS and Express ✅
- Part 4: Testing Express servers, user administration ✅
- Part 5: Testing React apps
- Part 6: State management with Redux
- Part 7: React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack
- Part 8: GraphQL
- Part 9: TypeScript
- Part 10: React Native
- Part 11: CI/CD ✅
- Part 12: Containers
- Part 13: Using Relational databases

Some of these topics I already have experience with, either with my own self study or in courses at my own university, but I will still complete those as a refresher.

According to fullstackopen.com, all 13 parts of this course are equivalent to 14 credits at the university, and each take on average 20 hours.
